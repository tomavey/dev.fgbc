Erik Jensen

Also! Use this time to reconnect with the people who have given you their info but maybe don't come to your church. Sinners need tiolet paper too




11:31 AM

Brad Gromis

Worship Wherever! That's a great resource.

Bartley Sawatsky

I'm blessed to have a staff that are oretty young and in touch with this technology, but I'm sure every one of our churches has people who understand how to do things like livestreams, we just need to tap into them




11:33 AM

Scott

any ideas for Easter? Anyone doing anything different?




11:34 AM

Scott Avey

So one HUGE question is just how long this is gonna last? I'm prepping my team to plan at least to Easter. (Being a portable church that is bound to the school is a huge part of that)




11:34 AM

Keith Minier

Scott  - we are recording a pretty extensive opener and are talking about doing baptisms from people's homes




11:34 AM

Scott Avey

Nice. Thanks Keith




11:34 AM

Scott Avey

Keith, are you doing simulated live, or actual live?




11:35 AM

Keith Minier

Simulated live




11:35 AM

Bartley Sawatsky

Guys, this is going to last a LOT LONGER than people think




11:35 AM

Douglas Courter

Scott. I'm considering a drive-in for Easter. Not sure it would really work for our people.




11:35 AM

Nathan

I'm very interested in how churches are leveraging the crisis to engage their community?




11:35 AM

ANDREW SAUNDERS

Our PA governer is saying it will last through April 17th




11:36 AM

Scott

Keith cool! 




11:36 AM

Douglas Courter

Any idea of how to keep people watching? Our watch rate was several minutes shorter than the actual message.




11:36 AM

Scott

Doug. I was thinking of doing drive in too. thinking through those logistics now.




11:38 AM

Nathan

Keith what are some specific ways you are directing your people to engage their community as individuals?




11:39 AM

Erik Jensen

I want to know where pastor Roland gets his jackets!

Bartley Sawatsky

Good websites like www.ourworldindata.org can help you see daily updated charts that can help you prediect the rise and fall of the wave. Here in NA we are just starting the ride.




11:40 AM

Keith Minier

Nathan - we are working with our local partners and asking them and then we are mobilizing our resources.




11:40 AM

Weston

We are asking our people to call neighbors, let them know they can help. Sewing masks for hospital, bringing diapers to Crisis Pregnancy center.

Scott Avey

Question: how are youth/children's ministries adapting to this?




11:41 AM

Randy Clark

sending out a post card to our surrounding neighbors with a link to pod cast and sunday sermon




11:42 AM

Bartley Sawatsky

Dan, that worldometer link isn't working for me...

REALITY:  The economic crisis will be greater and longer term than COVID-19.   Great depression 1.9 million job losses...We will in the next 2 weeks see over 2 million jobs lost.    Job Fairs...Career Coaching...Resume writing...Financial PEACE University




11:43 AM

Dustin

we are prepping packets for kids and shooting a video from the leaders talking through the activity craft that they would do on Sunday morning.  I am asking parents to RSVP for a packet and having them pick up the packet at church- bagging things and labeling them with names.

thx




11:44 AM

Adam Copenhaver

Some pastoral/shepherding questions: How do we comfort people who have lost their jobs and businesses and are now isolated at home? How do we connect with people who do not have internet access? How do we check on our at-risk kids whose homes are overcrowded and unsafe? How do we do pastoral visits at the hospital when visitations are banned?




11:44 AM

ryan bowell

thx dano




11:45 AM

Liz Gates

There is a story about the Five Dollar Club at Western Reserve in the last issue of GraceConnect. It was also a story in the eNews.




11:45 AM

Bartley Sawatsky

I,ve used that one too, Dan. Great website.

Barb Wooler

Encompass is hosting a webinar: Emotinoal First Aid in Covid-19 times. This will be on April 6th. Landing page isn't up yet but contact John Ward to pre-register jward@encompassworld.org  Must sign up in pairs.




11:48 AM

Daniel O'Deens

Let's Recognize..  IT IS A NEW DAY.   Are we thinking for the future?  Will it ever get back to 'normal'?  Do we even want it to?  Should you plan to maintain some level of community via online as well as coming back to the weekend event.




11:48 AM

Scott

Adam I am also wondering how to connect with people without internet. I’m assuming just call them more, but I would love more ideas




11:48 AM

Daniel O'Deens

We can GROW Our Churches during this season




11:49 AM

Daniel O'Deens

Your giving in part will be in proportion to your plan to service your community




11:49 AM

Bartley Sawatsky

Dan, great point. We're asking the same things.




11:49 AM

Keith Minier

Dave/ Barb - please be sure to let our churches know what the global needs are.




11:49 AM

Timothy Clothier

Adam & Scott, we’re trying to our video resources onto DVD for our old people and we hand wrote cards to the entire church last week and mailed them out.




11:49 AM

Daniel O'Deens

We do not create change...but we do need to step into it




11:49 AM

Timothy Clothier

Little things...but reminders that we’re praying and our people are not alone.




11:50 AM

Scott

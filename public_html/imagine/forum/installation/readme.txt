1.4 (released 8/29/05)
Unfortunately, I can't really list out the files that have changed since pretty much all files 
have changed. Here are the changes in features:

No need for a mapping.
A new settings.ini property, tableprefix, allows you to specify a prefix in front of each table name.

So what does this mean? Your old table names would have looked like: conferences, threads, etc. If
you needed to put these tables into an existing database, it may conflict with existing tables. Now
you can use table names with a prefix, like galleon_. Update the settings file with this prefix, and
Galleon will use the prefix when performing sql operations.

Default install scripts use table names with galleon_ in front. Default settings.ini file uses this
as a prefix.

Sticky Threads: If a thread is marked as sticky, it will sit on top of the forum.

Ranks: Allows you to give ranks to people based on the number of posts they have created.

Admin - updated the look a tiny bit, and moved some general stats to the default admin home page.

/messages.cfm - reworked the bottom link a bit

1.3.5 (released 7/29/05)
This releases changes how subscriptions work. In the past, as a user, you would just say yes or no to getting
email when people post to threads you posted to. Now you have explicit control over what you subscribe to.

You must updated your database. There is a new table, subscriptions.
Also, the users table has removed the "sendnotifications" column.
